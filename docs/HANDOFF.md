## Next approved task

### Build 1 — Manual Lifecycle Foundation (Experience and Adventure Loop v1)

- **Status:** **IMPLEMENTED — awaiting owner review of the implementation report.** Not
  committed/pushed. Implements the manual slice of
  [`docs/specs/EXPERIENCE_ADVENTURE_LOOP_V1.md`](specs/EXPERIENCE_ADVENTURE_LOOP_V1.md);
  Builds 2–4 (fallback, AI proposal, AI) remain separately gated. See the latest handoff
  report below for files changed, migration, and verification.

**In scope:** `/experiences` page with exactly five sections (new request; editable
constraints + manual plan creation; planned experiences; resolved history; Adventure XP
summary — **no recommendations section**); `experience_requests` + `experiences` tables with
**manual fields only**; four enums (`experience_request_status`, `experience_status`,
`experience_energy_level`, `experience_physical_difficulty`); manual NL request capture;
manual structured constraint editing; home-area prefill (read-only copy, never written back);
manual plan creation; planned list; one-way resolution to `completed`/`cancelled`/
`not_completed`; post-resolution correction of actual cost, rating, reflection,
non-completion reason, meaningful checkbox; server-calculated Adventure XP (10 / 15 / 0) with
recalculation when `meaningful` changes on a completed record; private resolved history; total
XP; one minimal `/experiences` nav link in the dashboard top bar; ownership enforcement;
validation; soft deletion; explicit DB-error behavior (no fabricated experiences); manual
API + browser verification; doc updates.

**Out of scope:** AI, provider deps/adapter, interpretation/recommendation provenance,
recommendation JSON, rule-based catalog, recommendation UI, web search, maps, weather,
calendars, reminders, notifications, voice, photos, public identity, automatic learning,
seed/demo experiences, dashboard redesign, adventure summary card, unrelated refactors,
dependency upgrades. **Deferred to later builds** (later migration acceptable):
`experience_interpretation_source` enum, interpretation/recommendation provider+model fields,
`recommendations` JSON, AI provenance, `selectedRecommendationId`, request statuses
`interpreted`/`recommendations_ready`/`closed`.

**File list (approved):**
- `db/schema.ts` (modified: 4 enums + 2 tables) + generated migration `db/migrations/0001_*.sql`
  + `db/migrations/meta/*`.
- `lib/services/experience-requests.ts`, `lib/services/experiences.ts` (new); `lib/types.ts` (modified).
- `app/api/experience-requests/route.ts`, `app/api/experience-requests/[id]/route.ts`,
  `app/api/experiences/route.ts`, `app/api/experiences/[id]/route.ts`,
  `app/api/experiences/[id]/resolve/route.ts`, `app/api/experiences/[id]/outcome/route.ts` (new).
- `app/experiences/page.tsx` (new, server); `components/experiences/{request-form,constraint-editor,plan-form,planned-list,outcome-form}.tsx` (new, client).
- `app/page.tsx` (modified: one nav link in `.topbar-right`); `app/globals.css` (modified: scoped styles + `.navlink`).
- Docs at end: `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md`, `docs/DATA_MODEL.md`, `docs/HANDOFF.md`.

**Implementation plan:** (1) schema enums + tables; (2) generate + apply migration `0001`;
(3) `lib/types.ts` view models; (4) services (CRUD, `getHomeArea`, duplicate-safe plan
creation, `resolveExperience`, `correctOutcomeDetails`, `computeXp`, `xpTotal`); (5) six API
routes (server-resolved `userId`, validation, one-way transitions, reject client XP/userId);
(6) `/experiences` page (explicit DB-error, no mock); (7) five client islands; (8) nav link +
scoped CSS; (9) `typecheck`/`build` + manual API/browser tests; (10) update docs.

**Acceptance criteria (must pass):** home-area prefill isolation; manual request + plan
creation; refresh persistence; duplicate-plan protection; completion with empty optionals;
completed XP=10; meaningful completed XP=15; meaningful false→true ⇒ 10→15; true→false ⇒
15→10; cancelled/not_completed XP=0; post-resolution detail correction; resolved cannot return
to `planned`; resolved status cannot change to another resolved status; invalid rating /
negative amounts rejected; client `userId`/XP rejected; non-owned ⇒ safe not-found; DB failure
⇒ explicit error and no mock experiences; `typecheck` + `build` pass.

### Proposed implementation breakdown (phased)

Each build is a **separate approval gate.** Do not start a build until the owner approves that
specific build. Builds are ordered so the manual loop works end-to-end before any AI exists.

**Build 1 — Manual lifecycle foundation** *(no AI, no providers)*
- dedicated `/experiences` page
- schema for `experience_requests` and `experiences`
- service layer and API routes
- manual request entry
- manual constraint editing
- manual plan creation
- planned experiences
- outcome resolution
- private history
- Adventure XP
- no AI
- no provider dependencies
- no rule-based recommendation catalog unless absolutely needed for the manual loop

**Build 2 — Rule-based fallback recommendations** *(no AI provider)*
- local recommendation concept catalog
- fallback recommendation generation from confirmed constraints
- selection and plan creation from fallback recommendations
- no AI provider yet

**Build 3 — AI provider/model proposal** *(proposal only — no implementation until approved)*
- provider
- model
- structured-output approach
- cost estimates
- environment variables
- dependency impact
- privacy and retention considerations
- enforcement of the $5 monthly development ceiling
- no implementation until approved

**Build 4 — AI interpretation and AI recommendations**
- provider-adapter implementation
- owner-triggered interpretation
- owner-triggered recommendation generation
- usage logging
- cost-limit enforcement
- malformed-output handling
- manual and fallback paths remain usable

### Build 1 — Manual Lifecycle Foundation — implemented — 2026-06-21

**Task Completed**
Implemented the Build 1 manual lifecycle of the Experience and Adventure Loop on a dedicated
`/experiences` page, exactly to the approved bounded scope. No AI, providers, recommendations,
or excluded features. Not committed — awaiting owner review.

**Files Changed**
- Schema/migration: `db/schema.ts` (4 enums + `experience_requests` + `experiences`);
  migration `0001_sour_kate_bishop.sql` (+ `db/migrations/meta/0001_snapshot.json`, `_journal.json`).
- Types: `lib/types.ts` (`ExperienceRequestView`, `ExperienceView`, `ExperienceXpSummary`, enums).
- Services: `lib/services/experience-requests.ts`, `lib/services/experiences.ts`.
- API: `app/api/experience-requests/route.ts`, `app/api/experience-requests/[id]/route.ts`,
  `app/api/experiences/route.ts`, `app/api/experiences/[id]/route.ts`,
  `app/api/experiences/[id]/resolve/route.ts`, `app/api/experiences/[id]/outcome/route.ts`.
- Page/components: `app/experiences/page.tsx`; `components/experiences/{request-form,
  constraint-editor,plan-form,planned-list,outcome-form}.tsx`.
- Nav/styles: `app/page.tsx` (one `/experiences` top-bar link); `app/globals.css` (scoped styles).
- Docs: `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md`, `docs/DATA_MODEL.md`, `docs/DECISIONS.md` (ADR-009 duplicate
  guard, ADR-010 delete-recovery), this file.
- (Local only, gitignored — not part of the commit: `.claude/launch.json` for the preview tool.)

**Database Changes**
Migration `0001_sour_kate_bishop` applied to Neon: 4 enums + 2 tables + FKs + indexes
(incl. a partial unique index on `experiences.request_id` where `deleted_at is null`). No
changes to existing tables.

**Current Behavior**
`/experiences` (behind the auth gate) supports the full manual loop: capture a request, edit
constraints (home-area prefilled, editable), create a plan, list planned, resolve one-way to
completed/cancelled/not_completed, correct outcome details afterward, view private history and
total Adventure XP. XP is server-computed (10/15/0). A top-bar link points to it.

**Post-implementation correction (2026-06-22):** browser testing found that optional enum
selects left at "—" submitted `""`, which the API rejected (`500`/`400`). Fixed by normalizing
empty-string enum input to `null` in the four affected routes (`experience-requests` POST/PATCH,
`experiences` POST/PATCH). Also added the request-recovery-on-delete behavior (ADR-010).

**Testing Completed**
`npm run typecheck` ✓; `npm run build` ✓. **Manual API lifecycle** (~30 assertions) — all pass —
covering request CRUD + validation, home-area isolation (DB-confirmed), duplicate-plan 409,
manual plan, edit-while-planned, one-way resolution, post-resolution correction, XP 10/15/0 +
meaningful recalculation (10↔15), resolved-cannot-revert, resolved-status-cannot-change, invalid
rating / negative amounts rejected, client `userId`/`adventureXp` ignored, non-owned → 404, and
**delete-recovery** (planned-delete → request `draft`; resolved-delete → stays `planned`).
**Enum-normalization tests** across all four routes: `""`→null (no 500), omitted-PATCH→unchanged,
valid→accepted, invalid-nonempty→400. **Full browser click-through (20-step pass)** via the
preview browser: nav link → request → prefill + home-area isolation → constraints saved with
selects at "—" → plan created with difficulty "—" → refresh persistence → edit → complete (XP 10)
→ meaningful 10↔15 → cancel/not-completed (0) → planned-delete recovery → resolved status not
editable in UI → mobile (375px) layout → no mock data. All test data cleared afterward
(`experience_requests=0`, `experiences=0`).

**Known Issues / Not Tested**
- `/experiences` DB-failure error state is enforced by construction but was **not
  runtime-simulated** (would require breaking the live DB connection).
- Browser click-throughs for the **original seven verticals** were not driven in a real browser
  (the `/experiences` workflow was). 
- `npm run lint` is **not runnable** — `next lint` launches an interactive ESLint setup that
  was never configured in this repo; no lint was performed (unchanged from prior builds).
- Deferred UX (non-blocking): the combined constraints+plan card is long/busy; the form `✕`
  cancel control has `title`/`aria-label="Cancel"` but no visible label.

**Decisions Needed**
Owner review/approval of this implementation before commit. Builds 2–4 remain gated; AI needs
the spec §18 provider/model proposal.

**Recommended Next Step**
Owner reviews and, if approved, authorizes the commit. Then Build 2 (rule-based fallback) can
be scoped.

### Experience and Adventure Loop v1 — plan phased — 2026-06-21

**Task Completed**
Recorded that the Experience and Adventure Loop **v1 specification is approved as the target
product spec**, while making explicit that full implementation is **not** authorized. Updated
the active-task title to "Finalize and phase the Experience and Adventure Loop v1
implementation plan," kept its status as awaiting review / do-not-implement, and added the
phased Build 1–4 breakdown above. **Documentation only.**

**Files Changed**
- `docs/specs/EXPERIENCE_ADVENTURE_LOOP_V1.md` — the approved v1 specification. Now holds the
  **authoritative final specification text supplied by the owner** (it replaced an earlier
  in-thread-authored draft).
- `docs/HANDOFF.md` — this file (active-task title/note → direct spec reference; phased
  breakdown retained).

**Database Changes**
None.

**Current Behavior**
Unchanged. Documentation only.

**Testing Completed**
None required — no code paths altered. Repo scanned to confirm no secrets/personal data added.

**Known Issues**
None — the authoritative final specification text now replaces the earlier draft. Per the spec's
§18, AI implementation additionally requires a separately approved provider/model proposal.

**Decisions Needed**
Owner approval of the **Build 1** implementation task (to be prepared next).

**Recommended Next Step**
Prepare the exact **Build 1 — Manual lifecycle foundation** implementation task (scope, file
list, acceptance criteria) for owner review. No implementation until approved.

### Documentation reconciliation — 2026-06-21

**Task Completed**
Reconciled the `/docs` knowledge base and `CLAUDE.md` so the repository is the authoritative
bridge between product strategy and implementation. Rewrote `PRODUCT_VISION.md` around the
owner's approved vision, restructured `CURRENT_STATE.md` by maturity, reclassified the
retroactive decisions, updated the root `README.md`, made `ROADMAP.md` a thin strategist-owned
candidate backlog, removed the separate `docs/tasks/` tracker, and recorded the leading
first-workflow candidate. **No application-code, schema, dependency, configuration, UI, or
behavior changes.**

**Files Changed** — `README.md`; `docs/PRODUCT_VISION.md`; `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md`;
`docs/DECISIONS.md`; `docs/DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md` (trimmed); `docs/ROADMAP.md`;
`docs/HANDOFF.md`; `CLAUDE.md`. Removed: `docs/tasks/` (directory deleted).
**Database Changes** — None. **Current Behavior** — Unchanged.
**Testing Completed** — Docs-only; repo scanned for secrets/personal data.
**Known Issues** — None outstanding for the documentation set.
**Decisions Needed** — The `[DECISION NEEDED]` items in `PRODUCT_VISION.md` / `DECISIONS.md`.
**Recommended Next Step** — Define the first end-to-end workflow's scope for approval.
